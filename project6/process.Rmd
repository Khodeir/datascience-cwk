The following report details the design of an AB test for a proposed feature on udacity.com. The feature being tested is to advise a perspective student against enrolling in a course if he indicates his intention to commit less than 5 hours a week to course material. Udacity.com intends that this change significantly reduce the number of students to enroll while not significantly reducing the percentage of them to eventually pay for the course. 

The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn't have enough timeâ€”without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course.

### Estimating Variance Analytically

We are estimating the variance given a sample size of 5000 pageviews. This represents 12.5% of the 40000 daily page views. 

**Gross Conversion**

In order to calculate this metric, we need to know how many people (out of the 5000 pageviews) are going to click "Start free trial". 

To do this I am just going to assume, naively, that the number of people clicking is the same as 

Under the assumption that enrollment in the course follows a binomial distribution with probability 0.20625, we can approximate its variance analytically using:

The sampling distribution's std:

$$\sigma_{\bar x} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

Binomial std:

$$\sigma = \sqrt{k p (1-p)}$$

Thus:

$$\sigma_{\bar x} = \sqrt{\frac{  k p (1-p) }{n} }$$

In our case, a user either enrols or doesnt, so we have $k = 1$

$$\sigma_{\bar x} = \sqrt{\frac{ 0.20625 (1-0.20625) }{400} } = 0.02023$$

We can also estimate this by generating a large number of gross conversion rates and calculating the variance. 

```{r}
# a large number of samples of gross conversion rate with sample size 400
X = rbinom(1000000,size=400,prob=0.20625)/400 

print(sd(X))


```

### Sizing
$$SE = \frac{\sigma_{metric}}{\sqrt{N}}$$
$$\beta = P(Z < Z_{*} \cdot SE | \mu = d_{min} , \sigma = SE)$$

At $\alpha = 0.05$  we have $Z_{*} = 1.959964$.

We set $\beta = 0.2$.

#### Gross Converstion

$$d_{min} = 0.01$$
$$\sigma_{metric} = 0.02023$$
$$N_{clicks} = 25699$$
$$N_{pageviews} = 2N_{clicks}\frac{40000}{3200} = 642475$$
With Bonferroni Correction for 3 metrics, $\alpha = 0.0167$:
$$N_{clicks} = 34277$$
$$N_{pageviews} = 856925$$
With Bonferroni Correction for 2 metrics, $\alpha = 0.025$:
$$N_{clicks} = 31122$$
$$N_{pageviews} = 778050$$

#### Retention

$$d_{min} = 0.01$$
$$\sigma_{metric} = 0.054949$$
$$N_{enrolls} = 39104$$
$$N_{pageviews} = 4739879$$
With Bonferroni Correction for 3 metrics, $\alpha = 0.0167$:
$$ N_{enrolls} = 52155$$
$$N_{pageviews} = 6321818$$

#### Net Conversion

$$d_{min}=0.0075$$
$$\sigma_{metric} = 0.0156$$
$$ N_{clicks} = 27169 $$
$$ N_{pageviews} = 679225 $$
With Bonferroni Correction for 3 metrics, $\alpha = 0.0167$:
$$ N_{clicks} = 36222 $$
$$ N_{pageviews} = 905550 $$
With Bonferroni Correction for 2 metrics, $\alpha = 0.025$:
$$N_{clicks} = 32902$$
$$N_{pageviews} = 822550$$

#### Sanity Checks

##### Number of cookies

$$ N_{control} =  345543$$
$$ N_{exp} = 344660 $$
$$ \hat{p}_{control} = \frac{345543}{345543+344660} = 0.5006397 $$

To sanity check this proportion, I will see if it lies in the 95% confidence interval around the expected proportion, 0.5. (I will do this assuming we are sampling $N_{exp} + N_{control}$ times from a fair binomial distribution.)

$$ \sigma = \sqrt{0.5*0.5} $$
$$ SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N_{control} + N_{exp}}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.25}{690203}} = 0.0006018407403$$
$$ z_{star} = 1.96 $$

Then the margin of error is:

$$ m_{error} = z_{star}*SE  = 0.00118$$

And the confidence interval is:

$$ 0.5 - m_{error} < p <  0.5 + m_{error}$$
$$ 0.4988 < p <  0.5012$$

Since $0.4988 < 0.5006397 < 0.5012$, the distribution of cookies passes our sanity check.

##### Number of clicks

$$ N_{control} =  28378$$
$$ N_{exp} = 28325 $$
$$ \hat{p}_{control} = \frac{28378}{28378+28325} = 0.5005 $$

$$ \sigma = \sqrt{0.5*0.5} = 0.25$$
$$ SE = \sqrt{\frac{0.25}{56703}} = 0.0021$$
$$ z_{star} = 1.96 $$

Then the margin of error is:

$$ m_{error} = 0.0042$$

And the confidence interval is:

$$ 0.4958 < p <  0.5042$$

Since $0.4988 <  0.5042 < 0.5012$, the distribution of clicks also passes our sanity check.


##### Click-through probability

$$ p_{control} =  \frac{28378}{345543} = 0.08212581357$$
$$ p_{exp} = \frac{28325}{344660} = 0.08218244067$$
$$p_{diff} =  0.0822 - 0.0821 = 0.0001$$
$$ p_{pooled} = \frac{28378+28325}{345543+344660} = 0.0821540909$$



I want to do a z-test on the difference of $p_{control}$ and $p_{exp}$. Assuming a binomial distribution for clicks given pageview, we can write:

$$\sigma_{pooled}^2 =  0.0821540909(1-0.0821540909)  = 0.07540479625$$

$$ SE_{pooled} = \sqrt{ 0.07540479625 (\frac{1}{345543}+\frac{1}{344660}) } = 0.0006610608157 $$

$$ z_{star} = 1.96 $$

Then the margin of error is:

$$ m_{error} = 0.001295679199$$

And the confidence interval is:

$$ - 0.001295649826 < diff < 0.001295649826 $$

So he click-through probability also passes our sanity check.

##### Click-through probability

$$ p_{control} =  \frac{28378}{345543} = 0.0821$$
$$ p_{exp} = \frac{28325}{344660} = 0.0822$$

Assuming a binomial distribution for clicks given pageview, we can write:


$$ SE_{control} = \sqrt{\frac{p_{control}(1-p_{control})}{N_{control}}} =  0.00047$$

$$ z_{star} = 1.96 $$

Then the margin of error is:

$$ m_{error} = 0.0009$$

And the confidence interval is:

$$ 0.0812 < p <  0.0830$$

Since $0.0812 < 0.0822 <  0.0830$, the click-through probability also passes our sanity check.

#### Evaluation 

##### Gross Conversion
$$ N_{control} = 17293 $$
$$ N_{exp} = 17260 $$
$$ p_{control} = 3785/17293 = 0.2188746892 $$
$$ p_{exp} = 3423/17260 = 0.1983198146 $$
$$ p_{diff} = -0.0205548746 $$

$$ \sigma_{control}^2 = 0.2188746892(1-0.2188746892) = 0.1709685596 $$
$$ \sigma_{exp}^2 = 0.1983198146(1-0.1983198146) = 0.1589890657 $$

$$SE_{diff} = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{control}^2}{N_{control}} + \frac{\sigma_{exp}^2}{N_{exp}}} $$

$$ SE_{diff} = \sqrt{\frac{0.1709685596}{17293} + \frac{0.1589890657}{17260}} = 0.004370125116 $$

$$z_{star} = 1.96 $$
$$ margin\_error = 0.008565445227$$

CI (around point estimate of effect-size): 
$$ -0.0205548746 - 0.008565445227 < p_{diff} < -0.0205548746 + 0.008565445227$$
$$ -0.02912031983 < p_{diff} < -0.01198942937$$

With Bonferroni Correction for 2 metrics, $\alpha = 0.025$:

$$z_{star} = 2.241 $$
$$ margin\_error = 0.0097933941$$

CI (around point estimate of effect-size): 
$$ -0.0303482687 < p_{diff} < -0.0107614805$$

These results are statistically significant, since the confidence interval does not include 0. They are also practically significant since $-0.0303482687 < p_{diff} < -0.0107614805 < -0.01$.

##### Net Conversion

$$ N_{control} = 17293 $$
$$ N_{exp} = 17260 $$
$$ p_{control} = 2033/17293 =  0.1175620193$$
$$ p_{exp} = 1945/17260 = 0.1126882966$$
$$ p_{diff} = -0.0048737227 $$

$$ \sigma_{control}^2 = 0.1175620193(1-0.1175620193) = 0.1037411909 $$
$$ \sigma_{exp}^2 = 0.1126882966(1-0.1126882966) = 0.09998964441 $$

$$ SE_{diff} = \sqrt{\frac{0.1037411909}{17293} + \frac{0.09998964441}{17260}} = 0.003433973029 $$

$$z_{star} = 1.96 $$
$$ margin\_error = 0.006730587137$$

CI (around point estimate of effect-size): 
$$ -0.0048737227 - 0.006730587137 < p_{diff} < -0.0048737227 + 0.006730587137$$
$$ -0.01160430984 < p_{diff} < 0.001856864437$$

With Bonferroni Correction for 2 metrics, $\alpha = 0.025$:

$$z_{star} = 2.241 $$
$$ margin\_error = 0.007695533558$$

CI (around point estimate of effect-size): 
$$ -0.01256925626 < p_{diff} < 0.002821810858$$

These results are not statisitcally significant since the confidence interval includes 0. They are also not practically signifcant since $-0.01256925626 < -0.0075 <  0.002821810858 < 0.0075$.
